# Deploy a Node.js application to Azure from Visual Studio Code

This tutorial walks you through deploying a Node.js application to Azure on
Linux in a matter of minutes from VS Code.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure account, [sign up today](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?utm_source=campaign&utm_campaign=vscode-tutorial-node-git&mktingSource=vscode-tutorial-node-git)
for a free 30-day account with $200 in Azure credits to try out any combination
of services.

You need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed along
with [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

## Install the Azure App Service VS Code Extension

The Azure App Service extension is used to create, manage, and deploy Linux Web
Apps on the Azure PaaS.

> [Install the Azure App Service extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice)

### Sign in

Once the extension is installed, log into your Azure account - in the Azure App
Service extension explorer, click "Sign in to Azure..." and follow the
instructions.

## Prerequisite Check

Before we continue, ensure that you have all the prerequisites installed and
configured.

In VS Code, you should see your Azure email address in the Status Bar and your
subscription in the App Service extension explorer.
